# Music-Player  ðŸŽµ

ðŸ‘‰ Introduction
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique of merging the data and the commands to process and convert them into the objects that can be used in a specific program. By keeping this fact into mind we have tried to design a music player as an academic task given by our worthy teacher. Basically the player is developed as an app by which we can play, listen, forward, backward, and delete the songs or a list of songs installed. With the help of following keys we can achieve what is intended or can command the program to come up with desired outcomes. For example; if being a user of program we are intended to quit the program we just simply type 0 and then press enter, by doing this the program will be shut down and stop playing the music. For comprehensive commands following bulleted list can be used as a guide, 
<br><br>
â€¢	To quit the program press 0 <br>
â€¢	Press 1 to play the next song <br>
â€¢	Press 2  to play previous song <br>
â€¢	Press 3 to replay the current song <br>
â€¢	To check the available list of all songs press 4 <br>
â€¢	To make a print of the list of  all the available songs press 5 <br>
â€¢	To delete the currently played song press 6 etc.
