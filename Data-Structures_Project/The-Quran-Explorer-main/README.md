# The-Quran-Explorer

# Introduction: 

ðŸ‘‰ Alif Laam Meem is a Quran Explorer Java Application. It is used to find Qurani Ayats with specific words. We just need to Search any English word and Ayats with surah name linked with that word will be visible to you.
Each Ayat has itâ€™s English Translation (Sahih International picked from Quran.com) and Arabic verse. It shows the Surah Name, with Ayat Number and Surah Number after searching a word.
We have used Binary Search Tree to load word file into program to attain (Log n) time complexity while Searching Ayats. We have used Linked List to link Ayats to words.
We used Separate Binary Search Tree for each Character like we do in English Dictionary Programs. We created Array of 26 BST Object, 1 Tree per Character.
